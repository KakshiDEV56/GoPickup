Welcome to **GoPickup** ‚Äì your modern, scalable, and secure parcel pickup and delivery platform, built with Go, MongoDB, Gin, and integrated with Twilio and SendGrid for real-time notifications!

---

## üåü What is GoPickup?

GoPickup is a robust backend service designed to power a modern parcel delivery ecosystem. It enables users to register, book parcel pickups, and track deliveries, while delivery partners (agents) can register, verify credentials, and manage parcel assignments efficiently.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Registration & Login:**  
  Secure JWT-based authentication for both users and delivery partners.

- **Parcel Booking:**  
  Users can create new parcel bookings with detailed pickup & drop-off information.

- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
  - Users receive email notifications (via SendGrid) upon registration and parcel creation.
  - Delivery partners receive SMS notifications (via Twilio) upon successful registration.

- **Delivery Partner Management:**  
  - Agents register with license verification.
  - Agents can view available parcels and update parcel status (e.g., "Pending" ‚Üí "Confirmed").

- **Protected Routes:**  
  Only authenticated users/agents can access sensitive endpoints.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Prevents abuse by limiting sign-in attempts and other routes per IP, defending against DoS attacks.

- **Payments Integration:**  
  Secure payment handling with Razorpay, including webhook support.

- **Realtime Tracking:**  
  Kafka-based GPS tracking for live parcel status.

- **Profile Image Storage:**  
  Store and manage profile images via Cloudinary.
